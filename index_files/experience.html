    <strong>2017 - Current: Prison Officer - Brisbane Correctional Centre</strong>
        <p>
            <u>Responsibilities</u><br />
Facilitate and enforce the orders of the courts while maintaining the safety and security of the correctional facility. My role covered a variety of posts within the units, back-of-house and front-of-house services including visits, searches, escorts, interviews and case management of all level of prisoners. 
<ul>
    <li>Maintain the safety and good order of the correctional facility. The key requirement of the custodial officer is to ensure that all staff, visitors and prisoner safety is maintained. I achieved this by 
        ensuring that all rules and regulations of the Center are always followed and ensuring all directions are relayed in a clear and simple to understand manner.</li>
    <li>Interaction with internal and external stakeholders. As a custodial officer I am frequently required to interact with a variety of people including Official Visitors, visitors, nurses, doctors, 
        paramedics, lawyers, police, cultural liaison officers etc. Being able to communicate with all 
        people in a polite and professional manner is a key responsibility within the role.</li>
    <li>Leadership and Pro-social modelling. Knowing the right from the wrong is always just as important and actively displaying these types of positive decision-making processes. Leading by example is crucial within this role. </li>
    <li>Perception and interpretation. Many of the people within the Correctional Centres are manipulative and vague, by having the dexterity to know and understand what is happening with noise 
        and distraction ensures that each person I work with can finish work safely each shift. This skill 
        is also essential within information gathering and the ability to perceive a person’s intention during interviews can help draw information out that would otherwise be missed.</li>
</ul>
