    <h2>SCUBA Diving</h2>
    <p> I've had my scuba diving ticket now for around 20 years. First getting my Open Water diving certificate <br />
        from <a href="https://www.kirradive.com/en/">Kirra Dive</a> at Tweed Heads. I was walking with my friend and was sure that you had to have negative<br /> bouyancy for diving.
        Naomi (who was much much smarter than I) pointed out that if you were negatively<br /> bouyant, you could not come back up. So we went in to ask the professionals.
        Turns out she was right<br /> (who knew someone with a PhD would have better deduction skills than me?).</p>
    <p>So from there I decided I should sign-up for a course, in the middle of winter. This turned out to be a kind<br />
        of blessing, as I was the only one in the class which meant I got the full attention of instructor. Anyway <br />
        from there I got my Advanced Open Waters, Rescue Diver and Enriched Air tickets from various locations.</p>

    <h2>Software Testing</h2>
    <p>It's video games. I like to play video games.<br />
    Currently (if I ever get free time) I'm playing through <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA08966_00-DAYSGONECOMPLETE">Days Gone</a> by <a href="http://www.bendstudio.com">Bend Studio</a> on the <a href="http://www.playstation.com">Playstation 5.</a></p>
    <img src="../Assets/images/Days_Gone.png" alt="Days Gone Logo" width="900"></p>
    <p>I also have <a href="https://diablo4.blizzard.com/en-us/">Diablo IV</a> on the <a href="http://www.xbox.com">Xbox: Series X</a> but again I just need the time.</p>

    <h2>Webpage Development</h2>
    <p>I started this course to help with our massage shop <a href="http://www.hiqi.com.au">HiQi</a> and create a website. As it turns out it's actually enjoyable<br />
    to be able to create (at this time) very simple websites. Plus it will also save me anywhere between $1000 - $5000 <br/>by not having to hire another company to complete it.
    Here are a couple of screen shots of my code when building this website.<br /> Only and all in HTML as per the directions from the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?kw=the+complete&src=sac">course</a>.</p>

    <h2>Furthering Education: Various Categories</h2>
    <p>As with most jobs and positions, ongoing education is a requisite to remain compedent within the industry. Like within the Correcitonal Centre and Remedial Massage <br />
    industry having a current First Aid Certificate is a neccessity and ensuring that my CPR skills remain current every 12 months. Outside of these I like to participate<br />
    in general up-skilling. So far I've completed additional certificates and training in:
<ul>
    <li>AustSwim: Teaching kids how to swim;</li>
    <li>RockTape: Level 1 Course (Kinesiology Taping)</li>   
    <li>RockTape: Soft Tissue Course</li>
    <li>TESOL: English Teaching</li>
    <li>PADI: Scuba Diving</li>
    <li>Sky Diving</li>
    <li>C++ Programming</li>
</ul> </p>
